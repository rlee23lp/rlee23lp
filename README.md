Hi, im rlee23lp and recently I've been in a computer science binge. I have been trying to figure how coding works / programs / tools.
I have no prior experience to this and I am learning from youtube videos, free-online courses(I'm broke trying to feed my family so the education is limited), and github. To be honest, I still don't know where to start.
I have been trying to grasp python, from what I have gathered far was that I should pick one language nd stick to it until I am proficient at it before branching off.
I really enjoy trying to figure out why my linux os isn't working properly, and figuring out what I have to fix, python has been a blast, love it, sadly however, my understanding of it is very limited, due
to only being able to practice on free online-courses. Would love to pay for a full course but I go a family to feed. So in the meantime, if anyone can send me to the right direction I would be grateful for your insight and empathy.  
My goal down the line to make this a career and hopefully be rather fluent in coding.
  So if anyone has any advice or tips please feel free to let me know. I appreciate anything.
  I really enjoy trying
